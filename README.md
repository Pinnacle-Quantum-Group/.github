Pinnacle Quantum Group (PQG)

Welcome to the official repository for Pinnacle Quantum Group (PQG), a pioneering force in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), secure software architecture, and advanced scalable platforms. We build solutions that address the cryptographic challenges of today while preparing for a secure tomorrow.

üåü About Us

At PQG, we are committed to shaping the next generation of secure communication and scalable computing technologies. Our mission is to design and deliver high-performance, secure, and post-quantum-ready solutions that empower organizations to succeed in an ever-evolving digital environment.

Our innovations include advanced cryptographic primitives, secure pub/sub platforms, scalable blockchain systems, and more, all developed with the foresight to address future threats from quantum computing.

üöÄ Core Projects

Aterna

Aterna is our flagship pub/sub messaging platform designed for high scalability and post-quantum security.

Aterna Community Edition: This open-source edition offers foundational pub/sub capabilities for secure, distributed messaging.

Aterna Enterprise Edition: Adds advanced features such as Lucene indexing, Bloom filters, and Merkle tree-backed immutability for compliance and security.

Post-Quantum Cryptography Solutions

We provide tools for robust lattice-based cryptography to secure data transmission, including:

PQC-enhanced TLS: Secure communication protocols resistant to quantum attacks.

PQC Certificates: Issuing certificates with both post-quantum and classical options.

Scalable Blockchain Infrastructure

Sharded Blockchain Solutions: Enabling massive scalability for secure transactions using PQC primitives.

Quantum-Resistant Consensus: Integration of PQC into blockchain consensus mechanisms to future-proof distributed ledgers.

Cryptographic Primitives

Our advanced cryptographic innovations include:

HyperChaCha: A stream cipher extending ChaCha20 enhaning, entropy, performace and security. Optimized for AVX-512 and AVX2.

HyperBlake: A hash function providing a 512-bit output with dynamic initialization, ensuring quantum resistance and zero-trust compliance.

Keccak Cube: An extension of the Keccak structure into higher dimensions for improved parallelism and security in hash computations.

MerkleCube: A multidimensional Merkle tree structure enabling advanced scalability and parallelism for distributed systems and blockchain solutions.

Intelligent Search and Analysis

Lucene-based Indexing: Fast data search capabilities for enterprise-grade deployments.

Neo4j Integration: Advanced graph-based data analysis and storage.
